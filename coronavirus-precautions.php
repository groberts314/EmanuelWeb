        <h1 class="page-title">Coronavirus Precaution Communication</h1>
        <p>
          As many of you have been watching the news you have likely read that
          the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">CDC (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)</a>
          and <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/" target="_blank">State of California</a>
          has recommended that people avoid gathering in groups to help slow the
          spread of COVID-19. Instead, we are asked to shelter in place.
          Because we wish to keep our congregation healthy and do our part as
          good neighbors in the community where God has placed us, the
          congregational council, Pastor, and Vicar have made the following
          decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We originally put out word that Emanuel would be closed for in person
          meetings of any kind including worship until at least April 5.
          Following the recommendations of the state and local authorities,
          <strong style="text-decoration:underline">
            we are extending that on campus closure through May 1, and possibly
            beyond if the threat of the virus still seems imminent.
          </strong>
          While this saddens us not to meet in person, we know that we still
          remain the Body of Christ. We know that this means not meeting
          together for Easter Sunday, nevertheless, Christ will rise from the
          tomb and conquer death even if we are singing His praises from our
          own homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This decision was made with heavy hearts as we know the importance of
          gathering with sisters and brothers in Christ. I personally thank the
          council for their dedication to continuing God&rsquo;s ministry during
          this difficult time.  Outside groups have also been asked not to meet
          at Emanuel during this time. If state or national precautions change
          during this time we will change accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, just because we are not meeting in person does not mean that
          we cannot continue to BE the Church of Christ! We are called to be the
          church wherever we are; in our homes, at work, at school, in our
          neighborhoods, and even during a pandemic. We are the Church. I also
          believe that this is a time when we are given the great responsibility
          to shine the light of Christ into the dark places of our world.  To
          help you along with your continued mission and to offer you guidance
          during this season of Lent, we will be offering the following modified
          ministries:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Emanuel Sunday Worship Online &ndash;</strong>
          As we did last week, we will be recording a short service of
          Scripture, song, sermon and prayers for you to watch. This will be up
          on our Facebook page as well as our
          <a href="http://elclh.org">church website</a> each Sunday morning.
          We invite you to participate in this time of church together.
          Additionally we will be emailing a weekly Bulletin, it will contain
          some information needed for the worship service as well as
          announcements for the ministries we are continuing.  If you would like
          to receive this please email
          <a href="mailto:churchinfo@elclh.org">churchinfo@elclh.org</a> to be
          added to the mailing list.

        <p>
          <strong>Wednesday Bible Study by Zoom &ndash;</strong>

          Polsdofer uses this for most of his classes. This Bible Study can be'

          <strong>Finally, remember – you are not alone. God is with you, with us all.</strong>
          We urge you to watch

            Presiding Bishop Eaton&rsquo;s video message
          </a> on the current situation. We promise to keep you informed as the
          situation changes; we will update you through e-mail notices and
          through social media. Again – be not afraid, for even in our anxiety
          and uncertainty, God is with us – Emanuel – and will bring us through
          this crisis into fuller and more abundant life.
        </p>
        <p>
          May the peace that passes all understanding be with you all.

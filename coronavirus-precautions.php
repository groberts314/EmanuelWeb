        <h1 class="page-title">Coronavirus Precaution Communication</h1>
        <p>
          In this time of near universal concern about the spread of the
          Coronavirus/COVID-19 and based on recommendations and information from
          the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">CDC (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)</a>,
          state agencies and the synod office, our main focus is to protect our
          members and to limit/avoid spreading of COVID-19 in our church, our
          community, and society.  As we do have many elderly and potentially
          vulnerable members in our congregation, we want lovingly to protect,
          cautiously to prevent and diligently to promote safety, social
          distance and sensible precaution. We would rather error on the side of
          caution while this is unfolding.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            This coming Sunday, March 15, Worship will not be held live at Emanuel.
          </strong>
          Instead we will be recording a short service of Scripture, song,
          sermon and prayers for you to watch. This will be up on our Facebook
          page as well as this website beginning Sunday morning.  We invite you
          to participate in this time of church together. This can be a time
          when even though we are all physically apart, we know that as a
          congregation we are all together in worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following events have also been cancelled this week: Joy Circle,
          Study Buddies, Wednesday Bible Study, Mentor Dinner Night and Lenten
          Midweek Gathering.  Any other groups meeting this week will be
          contacted by their leaders regarding whether or not their groups are
          meeting. Emanuel Lutheran Preschool has decided to follow the
          precautionary measures taken by the La Habra City School District and
          will be closed for two weeks starting March 16.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of Friday, March 13,  we do not have plans to change worship and
          cancel other activities beyond this week; however, if that changes we
          will be notifying you via email. The church phone is listed below but
          may not be answered as our office is normally closed over the weekend.
          If your phone call is not immediately answered, please leave a message
          and you will be contacted. Responding to email at this time may result
          in a faster response. Please do not hesitate to call Pastor Cate Luehr
          or Vicar Matt Polsdofer (phone numbers can be found in your church
          directory), if you have any concerns to address, questions to ask, or
          simply need to talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we know that nothing can really compare to being in the presence
          of our brothers and sisters in Christ while we worship our Lord, we
          also realize that sometimes this innovation allows for more people and
          new people to hear the Good News! We did a live stream of our Thursday
          Night Lenten Gathering this past week and have over 140 views compared
          to 50 participants in person the previous week.  Perhaps we can look
          at this as a chance for us the share our message of the Grace of God
          beyond our walls.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Finally, remember – you are not alone. God is with you, with us all.</strong>
          We urge you to watch
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=S6Nd_T4R_EY" target="_blank">
            Presiding Bishop Eaton&rsquo;s video message
          </a> on the current situation. We promise to keep you informed as the
          situation changes; we will update you through e-mail notices and
          through social media. Again – be not afraid, for even in our anxiety
          and uncertainty, God is with us – Emanuel – and will bring us through
          this crisis into fuller and more abundant life.
        </p>
        <p>
          May the peace that passes all understanding be with you all.

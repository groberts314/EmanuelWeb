          Study Buddies, our new free tutoring program for grades 1-6, takes place here at Emanuel on Tuesdays and
          Thursdays from 3:30-5:00 PM in the Hope Center Library.  This tutoring group is open to all children and
          students are welcome to come on an as-needed basis. We often have enough volunteer tutors for students to
          receive one-on-one attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          If students finish their homework before their parents come to pick them up, we have a children&rsquo;s
          library from which they can borrow a book in their reading level and practice reading aloud or silently.
          Students are also given a little snack and incentive prizes for their efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a dedicated group of tutors willing to help students in all areas of their schooling.  All tutors have
          received Child Safety training and have had background checks. A number of our tutors are also retired
          teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are interested, please contact the church office or stop by on a Tuesday or Thursday between 3:30-5:30
          and talk with the Study Buddies coordinator Jill Drummond. Applications are available at Emanuel and via the
          links below.

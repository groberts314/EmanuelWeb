        <h2 class="section-title">Seekers</h2>
        <p>
          This group is for K – 6th grade. It meets regularly on Thursday evenings
          from 6 – 7 pm. Mary Ann Carlson leads this group with help from some of
          our high school youth. The evening usually consists of games and a lesson.
          Lesson topics vary but all have to do with teaching about God’s word and
          how to apply it in everyday life. The Seekers group also works on musicals
          that the church perform twice a year at Christmas time and in the spring.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Sunday School</h2>
        <p>
          We at Emanuel Lutheran Church are blessed with a wonderful Sunday School
          program taught by loving dedicated teachers. We currently offer classes
          beginning at age three through high school meeting at 10am on Sunday morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          The younger grades are currently using curriculum published by Augsburg
          Fortress entitled <em>SPARK</em>.  Students spend a number of weeks
          learning about the same Bible story through a variety of different mediums
          such as art, storytelling and drama, cooking, music, and games.  Students
          also spend time with the &ldquo;Buck Denver: What&rsquo;s in the Bible?&rdquo;
          series as they get to dig deeper into the Holy Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our older youth meet in the youth room on Sunday mornings for an in depth
          Bible study. Youth and their  teachers take time delving into God&rsquo;s
          word and un packing what our Lord teaches us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We love to see new faces at any time and relish the opportunity to
          spread the Good News of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

        <h2 class="section-title top">Trunk or Treat</h2>
        <p>
          Every October on the Sunday before Halloween everyone is invited to
          join in the fun of Trunk or Treat! Join us for dinner, games, crafts
          and face painting. Then stay to go &ldquo;trick-or-treating&rdquo;
          among all of the decorated cars and trucks! This is a great event for
          the whole family.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Vacation Bible School</h2>
        <p>
          Every Summer for one week Emanuel holds a VBS program where
          kids can come to learn about God through songs, stories, games and crafts.
          Youth and adults volunteer to make this truly a community event.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Confirmation</h2>
        <p>
          Confirmation is a two year intentional faith formation program for
          youth in 7th grade and up.  Youth meet during the school year on
          Thursday evenings from 6 to 7 for class led by the Pastors and attend an
          annual confirmation retreat. Along with covering the Bible and
          Luther&rsquo;s Small Catechism, students have great discussions
          about what it means to be a person of faith.  Each student is also
          partnered with an adult member of the congregation who walks with them
          during these two years and supports them in their faith journey. These mentors
          also participate in a monthly dinner and Bible Study with their confirmation
          students.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Community Service</h2>
        <p>
          Another area of Christian life we promote in Sunday School and with
          our young people is serving others.  We collect a weekly offering and
          put it toward a specific project or donation to assist some outreach
          ministries.  We believe that it&rsquo;s never too soon to learn how to
          serve others. Our Youth also regularly do volunteering and outreach in
          our community. At Emanuel we take to heart the command Jesus gave to
          &ldquo;Love our neighbors as ourselves.&rdquo;

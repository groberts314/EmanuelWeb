          Pastor Dennis Laherty
        </h2>
        <p>
          Pastor Dennis Laherty was Called as Pastor of Emanuel Lutheran Church for a second time in 2023.
          His first time serving Emanuel began in 2005 and ended in 2018 with his retirement. After serving for
          two years on the Pacifica Synod staff and actually retiring for two years, the Spirit Called him to
          come back to Emanuel, as did the congregation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pastor Laherty is a graduate of Christ Seminary/Seminex in Chicago. Following his Ordination he served

          Pastor Laherty served for 20 years in the U.S. Navy as a Chaplain. Currently, in addition to serving Emanuel,
          he is also a member of the La Habra Heights City Council. He believes that the church is a significant part of
          the Kingdom of God and that the Bible is not only a God-given guidebook for life but leads individuals to
          forgiveness and redemption through Jesus Christ. Pastor Laherty preaches only sermons based on Biblical texts.
          He also firmly believes that life in Christ is strengthened by the frequent reception of Holy Communion.

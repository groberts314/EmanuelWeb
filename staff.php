        <p>
          Pastor Cate Luehr joined the ministry staff at Emanuel Lutheran Church in July of 2009.
          Her time at Emanuel has been focused on faith formation of all ages. With a history of
          working with youth, fostering a growing and vibrant faith amongst young people has always
          been part of Pastor Cate&rsquo;s ministry.  However she is quick to share that our lives of
          faith never stop evolving and as adults we need to keep exploring how we live out our
          relationship with our Lord. Just as our lives and world change and shape who we are, so do
          our lives in Christ.  Pastor Cate&rsquo;s preaching and teaching reflect the promise that in
          Jesus Christ we have been forgiven of our sins and called to be disciples, showing our
          love of the Lord by loving our neighbor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pastor Cate grew up in Northern Minnesota.  In May 2009 she graduated from Luther Seminary in
          St. Paul, Minnesota, and was ordained shortly following graduation. Prior to entering seminary Pastor
          Cate worked as a Director of Educational Ministries in Salem, Virginia.  She is married to
          Clayton Mark, a third grade teacher in the Whittier City School District.

          Vicar Matt Polsdofer
        </h2>
        <p>
          Matt joined Emanuel in June of 2019 as part of his pastoral education.
          He is currently a graduate student at Luther Seminary in St. Paul,
          Minnesota. He is part of a pilot program with Luther in their new
          program called &ldquo;MDivX.&rdquo; The traditional time it takes to
          get through seminary is 4 years, but in this pilot program it is 2
          years. Instead of doing a traditional year long internship Matt will
          be with Emanuel for 2 years in this program. Before moving to La Habra
          and serving Emanuel, Matt was a full time stay at home dad and worked
          part time at serving Immanuel Lutheran in Forest City, Iowa. He worked
          there for 7 years doing middle school and high school youth ministry.
          Prior to church work Matt has worked as an admissions counselor,
          insurance agent and in the retirement industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt graduated from Concordia University Chicago where he met his
          wonderful wife Jenni. They have three children together. They
          previously lived in Forest City, Iowa for 9 years. It has been amazing
          to see how the congregation has opened its arm to the Polsdofer
          family.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Matt was meeting with Pastor Cate Luehr, he felt God calling him
          to Emanuel. He knew that this would be a great environment for himself
          and his family to grow into their ministry call. Matt enjoys working
          with people of all ages and building relationships. It is amazing to
          get to know people more and hear their faith stories and how God is
          impacting their lives. He will focus on learning congregational care,
          preaching and sharing Christ&rsquo;s love with all the many ministry
          opportunities here at Emanuel.

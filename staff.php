          Pastoral Intern Amanda Pulos
        </h2>
        <p>
          Pastoral Intern Amanda Pulos has had a long journey into ministry. She first felt called to be a pastor in
          high school, but chose to respond to that call in many different ways before beginning her seminary journey.
          Amanda was born and raised in Orange County, California, where she owned and operated three small businesses
          and served as Director of Youth and Children&rsquo;s Ministry at King of Glory Lutheran Church in Fountain Valley.
        </p>
        <p>
          She served Emanuel as Assistant Minister to Pastor Dennis Laherty for ten months prior to his retirement. Now, as
          she serves Emanuel as Pastoral Intern, Amanda&rsquo;s heart is filled with excitement to see where the Holy Spirit
          will lead both her and the congregation. She has a deep passion for lifting up people from all walks of life and all
          ages, and she believes that every human being is created in the image of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amanda would love to get a cup of coffee or tea and spend time getting to know you&mdash;please feel free to reach out
          and chat anytime.

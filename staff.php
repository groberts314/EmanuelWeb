          Pastor Sandy Bentz<br />
          Interim Pastor
        </h2>
        <p>
          Pastor Sandy joined us in June 2021 as Emanuel&rsquo;s Intentional
          Interim Pastor. Besides doing the usual things pastors do (preach,
          teach, lead worship, baptize, provide pastoral care, etc.), she has
          special training in walking with congregations as they navigate
          transitional times.  She loves the Lord and is looking forward to
          helping us celebrate God&rsquo;s faithfulness as we discover and
          explore the gifts God has given us, and move toward the new future
          and new &ldquo;settled&rdquo; pastor God has planned for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pastor Sandy grew up in Chicago and has pastored churches in the
          Midwest as well as in Central and Southern California.  She delights
          in daughters Kristin (Toph) and Kari (Jay) and grandkids James, Julia,
          Kaitlyn and one-on-the-way.  Pastor Sandy&rsquo;s passion is sharing
          with others the freedom and joy that comes from experiencing
          God&rsquo;s grace and knowing that <em>WE ARE God&rsquo;s beloved children!</em>
          Knowing God loves us completely and unconditionally frees us to live
          for Jesus, for the sake of others. Real joy comes from trusting God to
          work through us, in all times and circumstances, to embody God&rsquo;s
          love, healing and wholeness for the world.

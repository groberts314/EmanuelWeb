        <p>
          Pastor Cate Luehr joined the ministry staff at Emanuel Lutheran Church in July of 2009.
          Her time at Emanuel has been focused on faith formation of all ages. With a history of
          working with youth, fostering a growing and vibrant faith amongst young people has always
          been part of Pastor Cate&rsquo;s ministry.  However she is quick to share that our lives of
          faith never stop evolving and as adults we need to keep exploring how we live out our
          relationship with our Lord. Just as our lives and world change and shape who we are, so do
          our lives in Christ.  Pastor Cate&rsquo;s preaching and teaching reflect the promise that in
          Jesus Christ we have been forgiven of our sins and called to be disciples, showing our
          love of the Lord by loving our neighbor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pastor Cate grew up in Northern Minnesota.  In May 2009 she graduated from Luther Seminary in
          St. Paul, Minnesota, and was ordained shortly following graduation. Prior to entering seminary Pastor
          Cate worked as a Director of Educational Ministries in Salem, Virginia.  She is married to
          Clayton Mark, a third grade teacher in the Whittier City School District.

          Vicar Maria Markman
        </h2>
        <p>
          Maria joined Emanuel in August of 2018 as a part of her Pastoral Education. She currently is a graduate
          student at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota earning her Master of Divinity degree. Maria is excited to
          learn and grow with Emanuel during her year-long internship here in La Habra, California. Before pursuing her
          call to ministry, Maria taught and performed around the world with the Young Americans and got her
          undergraduate degree in English with an emphasis on creative writing from Concordia University in St. Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the moment Maria met Pastor Cate and learned about Emanuel Lutheran Church, she knew this was the place
          she wanted to learn how to be a pastor. Maria is fascinated by the innate spirituality of children and love to
          cultivate wonder filled faith in all ages. She will focus her learning on preaching, parish life, and
          proclaiming the light of Christ through the many ministry opportunities at Emanuel.

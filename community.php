        <p>
          Emanuel is blessed to have community groups that use our campus throughout the year for meetings. We see
          these groups as another extension of our outreach to provide a place of healing, learning and support.

          <a href="http://www.oc-aa.org/" target="_blank">Alcoholics Anonymous</a> (AA) is a fellowship of men and women who
          share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help
          others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.

        <p>
          <a href="http://www.ocalanon.org/" target="_blank">Al-Anon</a>&rsquo;s purpose is to help friends and families
          of alcoholics recover from the effects of living with the problem drinking of a relative or friend. Our focus
          is on ourselves, not the alcoholic. The only requirement for membership is that there be a problem of alcoholism
          with a friend or relative.

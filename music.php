        <p>
          The Adult Chancel Choir meets on Thursday nights at 7:30 September
          through June. They perform a variety of music to enrich our 9:00
          traditional services as well as special seasonal worship opportunities
          and are accompanied by our organist. The Adult Chancel Choir is open
          to everyone who is interested in worshiping our Lord and Savior, and
          has a heart for learning. Special solo performers are selected from
          this group to perform at various different times during the church year.

        <p>
          The handbell ensemble meets Thursday evenings at 6:30 PM in the
          sanctuary. The ensemble is also open to anyone who wants to participate
          in ringing praises to our Lord. They meet from September through June,
          with special performances throughout the church year, including a
          Christmas Eve concert performance. Handbell ringing is an art, which is
          taught through weekly lessons to be applied in the music being performed.

        <p>
          Heart And Hands Outreach (HAHO) is a ministry of Emanuel that seeks to
          share the Love of Jesus Christ by word and deed. We believe that whenever
          we heed Christ&rsquo;s words that <em>&ldquo;whatever you did for
          one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me&rdquo;
          &ndash; Matthew 25:40</em>, we are spreading the Gospel. There are many
          ministries and charities that we work closely with throughout the year.
          For specific work we are doing at this time, please see our newsletter
          for the latest HAHO news.

              There are now two new ways to give your offering or donation to Emanuel!
              <ol>
                  <li>
                      Visit our <a href="https://emanuellutheran.breezechms.com/give/online" target="=_blank">secure online giving page</a>
                      (this will open in a new tab or window).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      You may also make a contribution to Emanuel Lutheran Church via text message.  From your mobile phone,
                      simply text a dollar amount to <a href="sms:+15622100007">(562) 210-0007</a>.
                  </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
              Online giving has been proven to increase total giving through creating healthy and regular giving habits;
              however, online donations come with processing costs, anywhere from 1-2% of your offering goes toward these
              fees.
            </p>
            <p>
              Three ways you can help the church save processing fees:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Give directly from your bank account like you would your monthly bills rather than online with your
                  bank account or credit card.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Giving by cash or check on Sunday Morning or through the mail.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Give an additional cover-the-cost offering.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

        <p>
          Jesus replied: &ldquo;&lsquo;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.&rsquo;
          This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: &lsquo;Love your neighbor as yourself.&rsquo;&rdquo;
          (Matthew 22:37-39)
        </p>
        <p>
          Emanuel means &ldquo;God With Us&rdquo; and that is who we are: a group of people who believe that God is with us in all we do
          and who try to live lives that proclaim that message. Emanuel has been part of the La Habra and Brea communities since its founding
          in 1960 and we continue to be a beacon of God&rsquo;s love in our neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our church is in the <a href="http://www.pacificasynod.org" target="_blank">Pacifica Synod</a> of the
          <a href="http://www.elca.org" target="_blank">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a>.
          As members of the ELCA, we confess the Triune God — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  We proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.

          We are a church that shares a living, daring confidence in God&rsquo;s grace. For us this faith comes through the good news of
          Jesus Christ and gives us the freedom and the courage to wonder, discover and boldly participate in what God is up to in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are a church that is always being made new, and at the same time, is deeply rooted in Scripture, Creeds and Lutheran confessions
          (<a href="http://www.elca.org/en/Faith/ELCA-Teaching/Scripture-Creeds-Confessions" target="_blank">more information</a>).
          It&rsquo;s through these roots that the Holy Spirit guides and nourishes us so that we can be a church
          that is both resilient and always new.
        </p>
        <p>
          We welcome you to join this community of faith regardless of your age, race, gender, life experience, complexities and questions.
          You have a unique story that can only add to the richness of the larger story that make up Emanuel. There is a place for you here!

        <h2 class="section-title">Wednesday Morning Bible Study</h2>
        <p>
          The Wednesday Morning Bible Study is a group of men and women of
          diverse ages who meet every Wednesday morning at 9:00 AM in the
          Hope Center Conference room. The purpose of the group is to
          create a no pressure, open, and lively discussion of God&rsquo;s
          Word, concentrating on one book of the Bible at a time. It is a
          time for fellowship and study, but all are welcome, it is not
          assumed you know it all. The study is pastor led, has 10-15
          participants each week, and uses whichever biblical translation
          you bring. We move at our own pace and historical, cultural, and
          contextual connections are encouraged to deepen our understanding
          of scripture in the midst of our ever changing world.

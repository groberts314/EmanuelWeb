          <p>
            Our preschool is a ministry of Emanuel Lutheran Church, a congregation
            affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and we are
            located in La Habra, CA.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emanuel Lutheran Preschool provides a peaceful, loving, caring and
            positive environment in which young children of all backgrounds can
            grow and reach their full potential. As we bridge the gap from home to
            school, we guide children to form a good self-image to succeed with
            social skills in the present and future school settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our preschool children are permitted to grow and develop at their own
            pace. They are offered a variety of learning experiences at each stage
            in their development, through materials and activities which are both
            child-centered and teacher-centered. Our preschool curriculum is
            planned to promote the whole child: spiritual, intellectual, emotional,
            physical and social. Weekly chapel in the sanctuary features basic
            Bible stories, music, and discussions at a level which children can
            understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            We value family support in our program in a variety of ways. Parent
            involvement in our preschool program enables the children to see that
            our preschool is a nurturing place for the whole family. Classroom
            parties, volunteering, donations, and preschool programs where all are
            welcome to attend becomes a shared experience which hopefully will be
            remembered by each child.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Our preschool hours are from 6:30 AM until 6:00 PM.</strong></p>
